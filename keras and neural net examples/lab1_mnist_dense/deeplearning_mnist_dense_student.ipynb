    "Regularization can help improve the performance of a network, specially when the number of network parameters becomes large and this leads to better performance in training data than in test data, which is to say, overfitting. One of the most simple and effective ways of doing so is by using **dropout**. In Keras dropout is imposed on the network by adding a **Dropout** layer. Such Dropout layer takes the outputs from the previous layer and randomly assigns $0$ values to some of them, so that the next layer only sees part of the outputs generated.\n",
